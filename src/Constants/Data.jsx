      "My GP recommended Priyanka after I sustained a sports injury, and I’m so glad I followed that advice. From the first session, she was professional, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable. She took time to understand my lifestyle and goals, making the treatment feel truly personalised. She explained everything clearly, gave practical home exercises, and ensured I progressed at a safe pace. My recovery was quicker and smoother than expected, and I feel confident returning to sport. Priyanka has set the bar high - I won’t be going anywhere else.",

      "In today’s fast-paced world, aches, pains, and injuries are increasingly common-whether from long hours at a desk, sports, repetitive tasks, or the natural effects of ageing. While many people wait until pain becomes unbearable, regular physiotherapy offers a proactive and powerful approach to long-term movement and wellbeing.",

    para3:
      "Regular physiotherapy improves strength, stability, mobility, and flexibility. By strengthening supporting muscles and correcting movement patterns, it reduces joint stress and lowers the risk of injury.",
